LibVault aims to design and implement a relational database system to perform library operations efficiently. This system will manage a collection of loanable items, enforce borrowing policies, track user memberships, and generate meaningful reports. By using structured data management with query functionality, our implementation will enhance the experience for both staff and clients.
